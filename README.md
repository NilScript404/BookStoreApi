# Bookstore API

just a bookstore api project based on the latest .net core docs from microsoft. im trying to learn .NET Core, SQL fundamentals, Design patterns and anything else that comes with building a semi large api.

**Current Focus:**

*   improving authentication and authorization (jwt).
*   implementing advanced search features.
*   refactoring to use Fluent API as the project grows.

this is not finished and i work on it whenever i feel like it. feel free to check it out, but its primarily for my own learning and there is not much more to it.
